# Wikipedia Viewer
Built for FCC

## Objectives

*  Enter queries into a search box and get the resulting Wikipedia article
*  Click a button to see a random Wikipedia article.

Note: I wanted to use material-kit.css on this project but since I do not have enough time as I'm learning C in school, I will just use this to learn Materialize.js 

Will post link to the CodePen once project is set up.
